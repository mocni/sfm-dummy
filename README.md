The project is using turborepo and it is organized in different parts :

- 2 apps :

  1. Frontend using [Angular](https://angular.dev/)
  2. Backend using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)

- 4 common packages :

  1. @smart-fleet-management/common package : typescript package shared between frontend and bff. It contains types, validation, enums ...
  2. @smart-fleet-management/eslint-config : common eslint configuration
  3. @smart-fleet-management/prettier-config : common prettier configuration
  4. @smart-fleet-management/ts-config : common typescript configuration

## Git Branch Naming Convention

- A git branch should start with a category : feature, bugfix, hotfix, docs or test.

- feature is for adding, refactoring or removing a feature

- bugfix is for fixing a bug

- hotfix is for changing code with a temporary solution and/or without following the usual process (usually because of an emergency)

- test is for experimenting outside of an issue/ticket

- test is for add or update documentation

Examples :

```shell
hotfix/no-ref-registration-form-not-working
```

```shell
feature/sfm-create-load-component
```
